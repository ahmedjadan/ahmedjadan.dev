# Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I am Ahmed, and this is my first post ever. i always wanted to have a website to document my learning jurney and to share the knowledge to the world, and today is the day!.

since i started my journey being self study student, i found that learning by writing is the best way to grasp things quickly.

> if you want to learn it, blog about it.

this is the first phrase every begginer in the world of programming and web development in general is using. for me it was on the `note pad` editor. i am still remember that feeling when the `hello world` printed to the screen between `<h1>` tags.
